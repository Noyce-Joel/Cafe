## Cafe Site

This project serves as an example of my ability to create sleek, animated frontends for businesses. 
The bakery is fictional and all copy and images were created using AI.

I used the utility-first CSS styling approach of TailwindCSS to create the UI, allowing me to test and fine tune with alacrity. This made the trial and error process of UX design quick and easy. All the components were built from scratch and are therefore wholly original. I was able to animate the majority of the UI using a combination of Framer Motion and React Spring.

On the contact page, I created a form that allows users to send emails from within the app. For this I used Axios and the SendGrid API. I also wanted to integrate with the Google Maps API, something I think is important for small businesses that sell in store. I also added the functionality to phone the business with the click of a button.
